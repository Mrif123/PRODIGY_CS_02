# Iris Flower Classification

Designed a Iris Flower Classification Model for predicting the iris flowers of different species such as Iris Setosa,Virginica and Iris Versicolor based on the Sepal and the Petal Attributes or features.

Machine Learning Algorithms Used:

KNN(k-Nearest Neighbour) Algorithm:So mainly this algorithm is based on the selection of k-nearest neighbours for prediction of the test class in this case it is the species of the Iris flowers.It is mainly upon the principle of majority voting.

Random Forest Algorithm:Random Forest Algorithm Classifies the species based on the number of estimators and also both these algorithms are effective and efficient for the Classification tasks.
