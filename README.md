#Image Encryption & Decryption Using Pixel Manipulation
Image Encryption: Image Encryption is a method where pixel values of an image are altered using a specific encryption key.The key that is specified acts a security parameter so that the input image is embedded with noise that results in a encrypted image and which cannot be decrypted by unauthorized users to decrypt the initial or input image.

Image Decryption: Image Decryption is a reverse process of encryption in which the same encryption key is used so that the altered pixel values are reverted to their orginal state which results in the input image as the output.

I have also designed a GUI so that the user can browse the file to input an image and provide a encryption key to encrypt the image and will be stored in the directory where you wish to save it the same encryption key can be used to decrypt the image to its initial state as the input image.

The glimpses of the GUI are attached below:
